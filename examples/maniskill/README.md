# ManiSkill multi-task PPO example

This example serves official RL-trained PPO state actors through the SDK's ManiSkill adapter.
Task coverage is defined by the benchmark manifest; model coverage is supplied separately by a
checkpoint bundle. `baseline_state_v1` preserves the original three-task reference.
`official_ppo_state_v1` selects all eleven tasks with compatible official state checkpoints.
The task inventory records remaining policies and native comparisons needed for full acceptance.

## Models and routing

The eleven checkpoints total **12.78 MB**, from immutable revision
`3558f72cf99d51d04a6ac4779e88b3da4bbf1628` of
[`haosulab/ManiSkill_Demonstrations`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/haosulab/ManiSkill_Demonstrations/tree/3558f72cf99d51d04a6ac4779e88b3da4bbf1628).
URLs, sizes and SHA-256 digests are pinned in [official-models.json](official-models.json).

| Task | Robot | State dimension | Action dimension | Horizon |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| PickCube-v1 | panda | 42 | 4 | 50 |
| RollBall-v1 | panda | 44 | 4 | 80 |
| PushT-v1 | panda_stick | 31 | 3 | 100 |
| LiftPegUpright-v1 | panda | 32 | 7 | 50 |
| PokeCube-v1 | panda | 54 | 4 | 50 |
| PullCube-v1 | panda | 35 | 4 | 50 |
| PushCube-v1 | panda | 35 | 4 | 50 |
| StackCube-v1 | panda_wristcam | 48 | 4 | 50 |
| TwoRobotPickCube-v1 | two panda_wristcam | 66 | 16 | 100 |
| TwoRobotStackCube-v1 | two panda_wristcam | 76 | 16 | 100 |
| AnymalC-Reach-v1 | anymal_c | 35 | 12 | 200 |

The dual-arm and quadruped checkpoints use `pd_joint_delta_pos`, LiftPegUpright uses
`pd_ee_delta_pose`, and the other checkpoints use `pd_ee_delta_pos`. Evaluation uses deterministic
FP32 actor means. The loader reproduces the
three-layer, 256-unit Tanh actor/critic architecture in the pinned upstream PPO implementation and
strictly loads the complete checkpoint. Input/output dimensions are inferred from the weights.
Observations retain the native flattened `state` order and scale; actions pass unchanged to the
configured controller. No external normalization, clipping or precision change is used.
The task manifest owns the evaluation horizon and seed list.

```bash
/path/to/runtime/env/bin/python examples/maniskill/download_models.py /path/to/maniskill-models
```

The downloader verifies cached files, fetches only missing selected checkpoints and writes
`models.json`. Its default preserves the three baseline models. Use `--all` for all eleven or
`--tasks PickCube-v1 RollBall-v1` for a subset. Store models/assets outside Git in writable shared storage.

A bundle maps task IDs to relative checkpoint paths and expected hashes:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "models": {
    "PickCube-v1": {
      "path": "PickCube-v1.pt",
      "sha256": "0b17b5ed9690ccf83111d0f09af8d1599f69ee7ba0077e1aac48814ac78ce99c",
      "robot_uid": "panda",
      "obs_mode": "state",
      "control_mode": "pd_ee_delta_pos",
      "max_episode_steps": 50
    }
  }
}
```

`Policy.load()` reads the bundle from `context.checkpoint_path` and loads each actor once.
`reset()` associates the episode ID with its task and checks the observation/controller configuration.
`act_batch()` groups independent episodes by task, runs each actor with its own input/action dimensions,
and restores request order. `end_episode()` removes episode routing state. A standalone official `.pt`
file is accepted when its pinned digest identifies its task. For another task suite, supply a bundle
covering its tasks with compatible PPO state checkpoints.

## Additional PPO state references

`reference_ppo_state_v1` uses four existing canonical profiles with the unchanged
three-layer Tanh actor/critic and all 17 original FP32 tensors. Immutable URLs,
dimensions, hashes and source identities are in [reference-ppo-models.json](reference-ppo-models.json).
It selects the first four rows below; `canonical_prior_state_v1` selects the last two.

| Target | Native / actor state | Actions | Reference |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| G1 TransportBox | 77 / 77 | 25 joint deltas | Author task-trained PPO |
| G1 Apple | 74 / 74 | 25 joint deltas | Author nominal PPO expert, retaining source clipping |
| PegInsertionSide | 43 / 32 | 7 EE pose deltas | Explicit LiftPeg grasp/lift-prior transfer |
| PlugCharger | 46 / 32 | 7 EE pose deltas | Explicit LiftPeg grasp/lift-prior transfer |
| PullCubeTool | 39 / 35 | 4 EE position deltas | Explicit direct-pull prior using the authored static workspace target |
| Go2 Reach | 35 / 35 | 12 joint deltas | Explicit ANYmal cross-robot joint prior |

The [TransportBox author checkpoint](https://github.com/tjvitchutripop/stream-rl-robotics/tree/30b2d8ecca093d9b9b492598aa9eeba70b628fd5/pretrained-models/transport-box)
uses raw state and actor means. The [Apple author reference](https://github.com/tabz23/Latent-Safety-Filters/tree/ea456084576b16053e6de79c52b489e33409479e)
clips its deterministic actions to the normalized controller bounds. Only its
catalog record sets `action_clip_bounds=[-1,1]`; the SDK Policy and direct native
evaluator preserve that operation. Other actors in the four-task reference suite retain their
original raw actions; the canonical priors have their separately documented conversions.
Independent CPU checks against the released author actors/critics, including Apple clipping,
are bitwise equal. R13 strict SDK/native checks passed for the first four canonical profiles and the
two [dual-Panda transfers](DUAL_PANDA_PPO.md), at N1/N2 prefixes and full target horizons. The
[current review](../../benchmarks/maniskill/NATIVE_REVIEW_VALIDATION.md) records the measured
cohorts and source identities; these small checks do not establish 100-episode acceptance.

Peg/Plug expose the same first 32 fields as LiftPeg: qpos/qvel18, TCP pose7 and
object pose7. Their records explicitly select this prefix while traces retain
the full target observations. Both quaternions and all seven action components
are retained; no hidden object/goal query, synthetic field or orientation removal
is used. Panda/WristCam share joint and controller frames; contact geometry and
task objectives differ. These are grasp/lift priors, not insertion experts.

```bash
/path/to/runtime/env/bin/python examples/maniskill/download_models.py \
  /autodl-fs/maniskill-reference-models --catalog examples/maniskill/reference-ppo-models.json
```

Use the same `ppo_policy.py` configuration and `native_eval.py`, selecting
`--suite reference_ppo_state_v1` and this bundle. The manifest retains every target's
original horizon, controller, observations and scoring. TransportBox's source
evaluator defaults to 200 ticks on CPU and its lock uses ManiSkill 3.0.1; Apple's
source simulator revision is not pinned. These references transfer checkpoints
to the pinned Kit runtime, without claiming the papers' evaluation protocols.
TransportBox specifies no source license; Apple code is MIT and its model card
specifies no license. Weights remain external to Git and evidence bundles.

The additional [canonical priors](CANONICAL_PRIORS.md) use `canonical_prior_state_v1`,
with unchanged target profiles. R16/b55 passed their full N1/N2 horizons and N2
five-tick prefixes including a smaller final vector group, plus an old-PPO prefix
regression. Their source models and transfer semantics differ from the four-task
`reference_ppo_state_v1` suite. Both new priors had zero successes in these samples;
they do not establish tool-use or Go2 task competence.

## SDK evaluation

Build the simulator through [the benchmark builder](../../benchmarks/maniskill/README.md).
The protocol is `maniskill-v1`; actions use `maniskill.native-controller-v1`, whose controller and
shape are provided in each task's episode metadata. The adapter supports state and RGB observation
paths. This PPO example consumes `state.proprioception`; separate visual Policies supply the
RGB references. Sixteen of the original eighteen tabletop RGB profiles have one full-horizon
real-policy/native comparison in R12; the other two belong to asset-deferred tasks.

Fill [roboscope-policy.json](roboscope-policy.json) with absolute executable, script and working
directory paths from your installation. The contract contains portable placeholders. Use the runtime's
manifest so asset and PhysX locations resolve against that build directory.

Quick Test runs the first task in the selected suite for one episode:

```bash
/path/to/runtime/env/bin/python -m roboscope_kit.runtime.benchmark \
  --benchmark maniskill --suite baseline_state_v1 \
  --benchmark-manifest /path/to/runtime/benchmark-manifest.json \
  --checkpoint-source /path/to/maniskill-models \
  --policy-config /path/to/roboscope-policy.json \
  --quick-test --output-dir /path/to/new-quick-run
```

For a representative multi-task run, fix K/G and request ten episodes per task:

```bash
/path/to/runtime/env/bin/python -m roboscope_kit.runtime.benchmark \
  --benchmark maniskill --suite baseline_state_v1 \
  --benchmark-manifest /path/to/runtime/benchmark-manifest.json \
  --checkpoint-source /path/to/maniskill-models \
  --policy-config /path/to/roboscope-policy.json \
  --episodes 10 --concurrency 1 --replicas 1 \
  --output-dir /path/to/new-three-task-run
```

This runs 30 episodes and 2,300 control steps, exercising two robots, different state/action shapes
and task horizons. Omit `--episodes` for the declared 100 episodes per task. Use
`--suite official_ppo_state_v1` with an `--all` checkpoint bundle to exercise all eleven models.
Each record retains its profile, seed, initial-observation hash, first action, actual steps,
`success_once` and `success_at_end`. Broader suites require a compatible real policy for each task.
The published state actors cannot validate RGB policies, and RGB acceptance remains separate.
The separate [Octo-small example](OCTO.md) serves the four Bridge visual tasks.

## Native GPU-vectorized comparison

`native_eval.py` runs the same actors directly on ManiSkill GPU tensors with the selected manifest
and task suite. It constructs the environment independently through upstream Gym and wrappers,
using GPU physics, explicit seed groups and fixed horizons.
Multi-task commands launch one child process per task before CUDA initialization, retaining each
child's logs, result and SHA-256 before validating and merging the complete task matrix.

```bash
/path/to/runtime/env/bin/python examples/maniskill/native_eval.py \
  --benchmark-manifest /path/to/runtime/benchmark-manifest.json \
  --suite baseline_state_v1 --checkpoint /path/to/maniskill-models \
  --episodes 10 --num-envs 10 --output /path/to/native-three-task.json
```

Default environment lifetime matches the SDK baseline: create/close per vector group. Add
`--reuse-environment` for a persistent native comparison and label that difference. Keep the same N,
seed groups and task configuration when comparing initial-state hashes, first actions, outcomes and
actual steps. Reset inputs can change with N even when scalar seeds match.

Verify the complete matching episode matrix with the simulator-free comparator. Pass the same
`--episodes` override when comparing reduced diagnostic runs.

```bash
python examples/maniskill/compare_native.py --sdk-output /path/to/sdk-run \
  --native-result /path/to/native-result.json \
  --benchmark-manifest /path/to/runtime/benchmark-manifest.json \
  --suite official_ppo_state_v1 --output /path/to/comparison.json
```

It rejects missing, duplicate and unexpected episodes, wrong task/horizon mappings, different
initial states, first actions, success metrics and episode returns. Numeric comparisons are exact
by default; any explicit tolerances are retained in the report. A disagreement exits nonzero.

Terminal masks are checked on both sides for full-horizon and prefix runs, with strict boolean
types. Use new native output containing the actual returned masks. Older PPO records lacking mask
fields are rejected; do not infer those values from the requested horizon or rewrite old evidence.

For separate correctness diagnostics, `--trajectory-dir /path/to/new-native-traces` saves each
consumed observation and action digest with its step number. The SDK worker supports matching
traces through `ROBOSCOPE_MANISKILL_TRAJECTORY_DIR`. Compare these diagnostic runs separately
from throughput measurements because copying and hashing each step adds overhead.
Pass both `--sdk-trajectories` and `--native-trajectories` to the comparator to locate the first
divergent consumed observation or action in each mismatched episode.

Output separates loading, imports/setup, creation, resets, rollout, closing and bookkeeping.
Single-task native formal timers include imports/setup and simulator lifecycle, excluding loading
and result writing. Multi-task output labels summed sequential child phases and reports the parent
command's complete wall time, including child startup and repeated model loads. Preserve external
command wall time; SDK and native timer boundaries differ. `inference_host_submission_s` measures
asynchronous CPU submission, not GPU execution latency. Per-task primary scores follow
`success_metric` in the manifest; both success
rates are retained explicitly.

## Original upstream entrypoint

The separate launcher runs the unmodified pinned `examples/baselines/ppo/ppo.py`. It verifies the
source blob, checkpoint and PhysX hashes and disables training, recording and model saving.
Select a checkpoint from the bundle with `--task-id`:

```bash
/path/to/runtime/env/bin/python examples/maniskill/run_upstream.py \
  --runtime /path/to/runtime --checkpoint /path/to/maniskill-models \
  --output-dir /path/to/new-upstream-smoke --task-id RollBall-v1 --num-eval-envs 10 --seed 0
```

`command.json`, `upstream.log` and `result.json` retain the exact invocation, evaluated steps/episodes,
metrics and complete child-process time. Upstream retains its scalar-seed and subsequent unseeded
reset schedule; this checks the genuine GPU-vectorized evaluator separately from the protocol-aligned
native comparison. Runtime pins, assets and acceptance results are in the
[benchmark documentation](../../benchmarks/maniskill/README.md).

## Additional real-policy references

The [LiftCube actor prior](LIFTCUBE.md) targets the existing canonical LiftPeg4
profile through `liftcube_prior_state_v1`. It retains the authors' complete
42D state input and active learned gripper, with explicit actor-mean mode,
EE-to-root conversion and two-tick action holds. R17/b56 full N1 and N2 prefix
SDK/native checks pass, including groups 2,2,1, with zero differences/failures/OOMs.

Task-specific [NEWT priors](NEWT.md) cover six control tasks, PlaceSphere, PickSingleYCB and a
separate PullCubeTool pose profile. Explicit transfer references are available for
[HORA Allegro](hora_policy.md), [TriFinger](trifinger_policy.md), [ROBEL DClaw](robel_policy.md),
[Unitree H1/G1](UNITREE.md), [Go2](GO2.md) and [ANYmal Spin](ANYMAL_SPIN.md). Their source-trained
robot/controller contracts and cross-simulator differences are documented separately; executing
these models does not reproduce their original expert success rates.

Further references cover [Humanoid control](HUMANOID.md), the
[ManiSkill-finetuned Octo visual policy](PANDA_OCTO.md), [G1 visual transfer](G1_VISUAL.md) and
[MS-HAB Fetch depth transfer](FETCH_MSHAB.md). Each records its exact source model/input/control
contract and separates interface validation from task competence and original-asset blockers.

The generic `native_eval_policy.py` independently constructs the native Gym environment, features
and action execution path without the Kit Worker or RPC. It intentionally reuses the same Policy
implementation, so agreement isolates SDK integration rather than independently validating model
inference or transfer mappings. Author-code and numerical checks provide separate, explicitly scoped
evidence for those components. Multi-profile references run sequential per-task child processes,
as the PPO reference does, to isolate native simulator lifetimes. Child logs and record hashes are
retained; child phase sums and parent command time have separate boundaries. Specify
`--policy-module /absolute/path/policy.py`, `--policy-class`,
`--policy-python`, `--checkpoint`, `--benchmark-manifest`, `--suite` and `--output`. Add matched
`--episodes`, `--num-envs` and `--trajectory-dir` for the native workload, then pass both trace
directories to `compare_native.py`. A diagnostic manifest can set
`benchmark_protocols.maniskill.diagnostic_step_limit=5`; retain its original environment horizon.
All such prefixes are labeled non-formal. See [the completion report](../../benchmarks/maniskill/COMPLETION_VALIDATION.md)
for the measured commands, coverage and unresolved asset/model gates.
The [native-reference review](../../benchmarks/maniskill/NATIVE_REVIEW_VALIDATION.md) records
terminal-mask fixes, passing R12/R13/R16/R17 cohorts and retained R11/R14/R15/HORA failures.
Cumulative compared coverage is 75 profiles / 51 task IDs across those source snapshots;
historical 100-episode-per-task evidence retains its original source identity.
