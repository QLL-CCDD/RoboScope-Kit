# ManiSkill evaluation protocol

Protocol `maniskill-v1` is defined by `benchmark-manifest.json`. It pins ManiSkill
`baab60ede2e89167c1b7aaed41a9aa8e690a9d1e` (`3.0.0b15`), SAPIEN `3.0.0b1`,
CPython `3.11.15`, Torch `2.6.0` with CUDA `12.4`, and NumPy `1.26.4`. The runtime builder
records source, package, PhysX library, manifest and asset provenance. Model versions, byte counts,
URLs and SHA-256 digests are declared separately in the model example.

## Scope and task settings

The [task inventory](TASK_INVENTORY.md) covers 58 literal task-directory registrations and nine
runtime scene registrations. Source-backed exclusions identify three helper/reference task-directory
environments and the scene helpers, leaving 55 evaluation tasks. The minimal source template is
inventoried separately. These counts describe the pinned source. A task remains unvalidated until
the exact task and declared observation profile run with a compatible real Policy and matched
native evaluator.

Each named suite uses 100 episodes per task and explicit seeds 0–99. The manifest freezes the robot,
native controller, observation mode, camera mapping, action dimension where known, full horizon,
reconfiguration, success metric and asset IDs for each profile. The selected robot/controller is part
of the protocol. Adding another embodiment requires its own profile and correctness evidence.

| Family | Declared robot/controller | Physics/control Hz | Horizon |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| Tabletop | Profile-specific Panda, PandaStick or dual Panda controller | 100/20 | Per-task upstream registration |
| TriFinger cube rotation | `trifingerpro`, `pd_joint_delta_pos` | 100/20 | 250 |
| Valve rotation | `dclaw`, `pd_joint_delta_pos` | 100/20 | 80, 150 or 300 by level |
| In-hand object rotation | `allegro_hand_right_touch`, `pd_joint_delta_pos` | 100/20 | 300 |
| DM-Control Ant and Humanoid | Native robot, `pd_joint_delta_pos` | 200/40 | 1,000 |
| DM-Control Hopper | Native robot, `pd_joint_delta_pos` | 100/25 | 600 |
| DM-Control Cartpole | Native robot, `pd_joint_delta_pos` | 100/20 | 1,000 |
| Quadruped | `anymal_c` or `unitree_go2_simplified_locomotion`, `pd_joint_delta_pos` | 100/20 | 200 |
| Unitree humanoid | Profile-specific G1/H1, `pd_joint_delta_pos` | 100/20 | 100 or 1,000 |
| FMB assembly | `panda`, `pd_ee_delta_pose` | 100/20 | 500 |
| Cabinet manipulation | `fetch`, `pd_joint_delta_pos` | 100/20 | 100 |
| Bridge digital twins | Native WidowX class and `arm_pd_ee_target_delta_pose_align2_gripper_pd_joint_pos` | 500/5 | 60 or 120 |

The family frequencies follow the pinned simulation defaults and task overrides. Each task's
registration supplies its horizon. The original tabletop profiles retain their existing controller
selection. The public LiftPegUpright PPO uses a separate `pd_ee_delta_pose` profile, and the two
dual-Panda PPOs use separate `pd_joint_delta_pos` profiles. The inventory links every task definition.
[Simulation defaults](https://github.com/mani-skill/ManiSkill/blob/baab60ede2e89167c1b7aaed41a9aa8e690a9d1e/mani_skill/utils/structs/types.py)
and [task definitions](https://github.com/mani-skill/ManiSkill/tree/baab60ede2e89167c1b7aaed41a9aa8e690a9d1e/mani_skill/envs/tasks)
are the source of these settings.

## GPU grouping, reset and termination

The default vector width is ten environments per Worker. Each queue item contains one profile and
an ordered seed group. Its last group uses the actual remaining lane count. The upstream
`ManiSkillVectorEnv` uses `auto_reset=False`, `ignore_terminations=True` and `record_metrics=True`.
Every group performs a full reset with its explicit seed vector and `reconfiguration_freq=1`.
Per-environment random initialization can depend on vector grouping, so a native comparison must
retain the same lane width and seed grouping.

Each task executes its complete registered horizon. A Worker plans a process recycle before evaluating
another profile, while the loaded Policy replica and same-profile episode groups remain in place.
The orchestrator requeues the unevaluated next-profile item and restarts that Worker context;
planned recycling is recorded separately from failures and retries. This avoids reusing the PhysX
contact-query context across profiles without changing episode identities or seed grouping.

Native task failures and success tracking
remain in the environment, while the wrapper's ignored terminations keep each lane running to
the time limit. The Worker checks terminal masks and native episode lengths. One control action
per environment is requested at every control tick. Episode-local Policy state is reset and ended
using a distinct episode ID for every lane. The benchmark protocol is implemented through the
pinned [vector wrapper](https://github.com/mani-skill/ManiSkill/blob/baab60ede2e89167c1b7aaed41a9aa8e690a9d1e/mani_skill/vector/wrappers/gymnasium.py)
and [BaseEnv lifecycle](https://github.com/mani-skill/ManiSkill/blob/baab60ede2e89167c1b7aaed41a9aa8e690a9d1e/mani_skill/envs/sapien_env.py).

## Observation and action mapping

The Policy uses the existing `maniskill.native-controller-v1` action representation.
`reset(EpisodeContext)` supplies task/profile identity, robot, controller, observation mode and
actual action dimension. Each action is checked against the upstream Gym action space, then
forwarded to the native controller. Multi-agent Dict action spaces use the pinned upstream
`FlattenActionSpaceWrapper` and its native ordering.

`state.proprioception` preserves the upstream flattened state order. A `state_dict` profile uses
upstream insertion-order flattening. Visual profiles expose the state already present in that
upstream observation and map declared camera RGB pixels to `images.primary`, `images.wrist` or
`images.auxiliary`. Native image shape and uint8 pixels are retained. The optional
`language.instruction` comes from the profile. Model-specific normalization and preprocessing
belong to the Policy implementation. The optional `include_joint_names` profile setting adds
actual active/controller joint identities to episode metadata without adding observation features.
The canonical Humanoid Walk/Run references use this metadata and their original 185D states.

The four Bridge tasks require the native `rgb+segmentation` observation mode, background overlay,
500/5 Hz configuration and task-specific WidowX robot class. The declared Policy camera is
`3rd_view_camera`. Their segmentation channel supports the native overlay path, and the Policy
receives the resulting RGB features. These profiles require a compatible visual Policy and their
own native comparison. They cannot be accepted through state PPO results.
[Bridge configuration](https://github.com/mani-skill/ManiSkill/blob/baab60ede2e89167c1b7aaed41a9aa8e690a9d1e/mani_skill/envs/tasks/digital_twins/bridge_dataset_eval/base_env.py)
defines that native path.

## Scoring and coverage

For tasks with native success metrics, the profile selects `success_once` or `success_at_end`.
Both native fields and episode return are recorded. The nine `MS-*` control tasks, Unitree H1/G1
standing and AnymalC spin have no native success field, so their profiles select mean episode
return. Their success counts and rates are null. Overall success uses only episodes belonging to
success-scored tasks and records that denominator explicitly. The unweighted task mean uses
those same success-scored tasks. Mean returns remain per task, since reward scales differ.

Every expected profile, episode index and seed must appear exactly once. Aggregation rejects
unknown or duplicate work items, missing or incorrectly identified records, wrong horizons and
inconsistent scores. `formal` requires complete coverage of the named suite at its configured
episode counts. `--quick-test` and reduced `--episodes` runs are incomplete supporting evidence.
Record-tree shard merging follows the same coverage validation. JSON-only `shard_reduce` has
no ManiSkill reducer.

Native comparisons use the same checkpoint, precision, profile, seeds, vector groups and full
horizons. Compare initial state and observation, actions, native returns, both success outcomes
where available, terminal masks and executed steps. A matching overall score alone cannot pass
correctness acceptance. Repeated runs measure native variation and any systematic divergence.

Every paired SDK and native record must explicitly store boolean `terminated` and `truncated`
values returned by the vector wrapper. Full-horizon records require `false`/`true`; prefixes
require `false`/`false` until the native horizon is reached. These are post-wrapper protocol masks:
`ignore_terminations=True` preserves the full rollout and `auto_reset=False` prevents a reset before
recording. Success/failure signals remain separate native metrics. The comparator rejects missing,
non-boolean or incorrect masks on either side. Historical native PPO archives without these fields
remain historical and require new native output; fields must not be inferred or backfilled.

Multi-profile PPO and generic native references run sequential per-task child processes. This
isolates the upstream simulator lifetime without changing seed groups, observations, actions or
horizons. Each child must return its exact expected episode identities before its unchanged records
are merged. Child phase sums and complete parent command time are reported separately; failed child
logs and commands remain available. This native-reference strategy is not a Kit runtime speedup.

## Assets and build provenance

`benchmarks/maniskill/build-runtime.sh <install-dir>` builds the simulator into a fresh directory.
`MANISKILL_ASSET_SUITES` selects comma-separated named suites. `MANISKILL_ASSET_DIR` selects
shared asset storage. `MANISKILL_ASSET_TASKS` adds comma-separated task IDs, and
`MANISKILL_ASSET_ARCHIVE_DIR` selects an archive cache. The asset helper
accepts repeated `--suite` and `--task-id`, estimates transfer size with `--estimate`, and records
installed-file/tree hashes. Manifest asset IDs include robot downloads as well as task objects.
Source-supplied checksums and immutable official archive overrides are verified before use.

```bash
/path/to/runtime/env/bin/python /path/to/runtime/prepare-assets.py \
  --benchmark-manifest /path/to/runtime/benchmark-manifest.json \
  --asset-dir /path/to/runtime/assets --suite upstream_tasks_v1 --estimate
```

The source/library cache overrides are `MANISKILL_SOURCE_ARCHIVE` and
`MANISKILL_PHYSX_GPU_LIBRARY`. The required uv version is `0.11.14`. Assets and models retain
their upstream licenses and download requirements. Their technical availability is tracked
separately from license permission and real-policy/native acceptance.

## Timing and evidence

Record preparation, cold startup, model loading, environment creation, seeded reset, rollout,
result writing/cleanup, tuning and end-to-end wall time. Formal throughput uses completed
episodes divided by `metrics.json.evaluation_s`, with actual environment steps/s reported beside
it. Include total wall time to account for work outside that timer. Worker CPU intervals can
contain asynchronous CUDA work, and concurrent Worker interval sums can overlap.

Run profiling separately from speed measurements. Measure CPU, GPU busy, memory and VRAM with
their sample window and method. Report unavailable hardware counters or uninstrumented phases
explicitly. Retain raw per-episode records, logs, commands, runtime provenance, resource samples
and exact Kit source identities outside Git. The historical [three-task report](MULTITASK_VALIDATION.md)
belongs to its recorded source snapshot. Current task coverage and blockers must be reported
against the current candidate.

## Integration-prefix diagnostics and root observations

A manifest may explicitly set `diagnostic_step_limit` to a positive integer no larger than the
profile's native horizon. This bounds only the evaluator loop. Gym still receives the original
`max_episode_steps`, and records retain the actual native terminal masks, prefix length and native
horizon. Such runs are always `evaluation_kind="integration_smoke"` and non-formal, even if the
selected episode count is complete. Do not use prefix throughput as a full-evaluation speedup.
The generic `native_eval_policy.py` reference supports the same prefix; the older PPO/Octo native
entry points reject this setting.

`transfer_reference_state_v1` names four optional root-kinematics profiles and the separate
PullCubeTool NEWT pose-controller profile. Original profiles remain unchanged. Root profiles add
`state.root_pose` (scene-local xyz and wxyz quaternion), `state.root_linear_velocity` (world xyz)
and `state.root_angular_velocity` (world xyz), read from the native articulation API. Their native
`state.proprioception` vector is unchanged. Episode metadata includes active/controller joint
names and physical/control frequencies. Model-specific frame, joint and control conversions stay
in the example Policy. See [completion validation](COMPLETION_VALIDATION.md) for scope and evidence.

`humanoid_control_transfer_state_v1` adds three MS-Humanoid root-observation profiles without
changing the original state profiles. `panda_visual_rgb_v1` selects the original 18 tabletop RGB
profiles and a separate FMB RGB profile. `g1_visual_rgb_v1` adds two head-camera profiles with actual
root observations. All retain the target task's native horizon, controller, reset and score; model-side
transfer does not import source-task evaluation rules. The [remaining-compatibility report](REMAINING_COMPATIBILITY.md)
separates validated profiles, model limitations and original-asset blockers.

`fetch_mshab_depth_v1` selects separate cabinet profiles with the native Fetch head/hand depth
cameras. `depth_cameras` maps their unnormalized millimeter depth to float32 HWC1 features
`state.depth_head` and `state.depth_hand`, preserving signed native encoded/sentinel values.
`include_cabinet_contact_state` exports the live base-link,
TCP and finger XYZ/WXYZ poses, handle position, and pairwise finger/handle contact forces in the
scene frame. It also supplies actual active/controller joint names in episode metadata. These are
raw physical measurements; base-relative transforms, source-specific state ordering and absent-object
sentinel, grasp classification, depth normalization and frame history belong to the Fetch Policy.
The original cabinet state profiles and all native reset, horizon and success rules are unchanged.
The original processed PartNet assets remain necessary for task acceptance.

`liftcube_prior_state_v1` selects the existing `lift_peg_upright_state`; it adds no
profile and changes none of its 32D state, 4D controller, frequencies, seeds,
50-tick horizon or scoring. The [model-side reference](../../examples/maniskill/LIFTCUBE.md)
declares a TD-MPC2 LiftCube actor-mean prior, actual state projection, active
gripper, per-episode two-tick holds and EE-to-root conversion. It is separate
from the author's full MPC evaluator and the existing 7D official LiftPeg profile.
CPU source-function checks do not establish real-policy rollout acceptance.
